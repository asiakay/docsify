> # Politics and Politricks Poli(tics,tricks)

Words matter. They shape perception. Time and time again, proven. "A group of conservative business leaders will begin advertising against “woke capitalism” and the CEOs that it thinks are guilty of this."
!["One Million Dollars"- Dr. Evil](https://media1.tenor.com/images/e6bec27c8458c7b428d08043976e5d84/tenor.gif?itemid=4123675v) 20 percent of Ceo's don't give a shit about voting rights and have recently spent 1 million dollars on an ad campaign to act as a Scarlet letter on fellow CEO's that they feel have become too involved in social and politial issues.

> 1. Why the blanket crackdown? China is the King of Bootleg, beyond potential volatility, real-life blockchain usecases threaten that status quo. I call MOC (Manipulation, Oppression, and Control). With restrictions lifted, people are free to walk around and buy products, some of which more than likely would be counterfeit, from street vendors and unscrupulous merchants.  
> 2. Crippling cryptocurrency markets has a direct impact on Blockchain technology and use cases. In China, the people are taking advantage of incentives that allow their carbon emissions to be tracked through smart contracts. When they lower their carbon footprint by riding bikes, or driving electric cars, [they get tokens with economic value](https://forbes.it/2020/03/10/come-la-blockchain-puo-cambiare-la-nostra-societa/), redeemable at participating local businesses. As of May 2021, "China now accounts for [27 percent of global emissions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/05/06/china-greenhouse-emissions/), while the U.S. accounts for 11 percent"
> 3. Beyond the value of the coin, there's value for the people having access to decentralized protocals like IPFS and it's accompanying crypto, Filecoin. People that are denied access to choose going Facebook because of centralization have a way around that now.

Y Combinator 2014 Grad and IPFS founder/ Creator of Filecoin, has created an exchange, [Coinlist](https://coinlist.co/). Went to check it out and at that moment saw some my top alt coin crushes (algo, link, ) were down and a literal [NU](https://pro.coinlist.co/trader/NU-USD) coin was up. Based on [providing blockchain security solutions](https://www.nucypher.com/). 

Instead of each coin running on it's own blockchain alone. Cross Chain Blockchain technology creates links between blockchains. That's why I like Polkadex, the polkadot network is a layer 2 cross chain technology. They recently held the polkadot decoded virtual conference and touched on topics including, creating defi platforms, ewasm development the future of the platform and more. But they are not the only company working on this. 

WanChain is a competitor, with some decent documentation. Check out the [Overview of the WanChain Cross-Chain Implementation model](https://www.explorewanchain.org/#/technology/cross-chain).

"The Federal Reserve will release a research paper this summer that explores a move to a central bank digital currency."

It's wise for the Federal Reserve to compile all the research needed before jumping to act to be the first. I think it would be unwise to alter the pace of research and subsequent action in reaction to China's moves, but not making a decision and having a timeline is an exercise in futility.

“Our focus is on ensuring a safe and efficient payment system that provides broad benefits to American households and businesses while also embracing innovation,”

Embracing Blockchain technology with real-life use cases could  benefit American households. 

"Fed officials have emphasized the importance of getting the issuance of a central bank digital currency right rather than participating in a race with its global peers." 

With creative thinking, getting it right could mean providing innovative solutions to improve the quality of life for the most vulnerable.

"However, the moves of multiple countries, most prominently China, in the central bank digital currency (CBDC) space has intensified talk about how aggressively the Fed should move. China’s progress has stirred worries that it could undermine the dollar’s position as the global reserve currency."


Investors' wants and feelings shouldn't have influence over government policy. History has shown that most couldn't care less about the average person's basic needs. 

"“It’s going to take some time to do it right,” said David Treat, leader of the blockchain practice for Accenture, which is leading public-private research initiative into CBDCs. “We’re talking about a four- or five-year journey to real availability and usage and a lot of learning that has to happen between now and then to make sure how it’s implemented fits with each country’s social values and laws.”"

Cryptocurrency and digital currency are not the same thing and shouldn't be dealt with identically. It defeats the purpose of financial empowerment when banks and governments become so involved.  







Q. 
Is it important for the U.S. to move faster than global competitors?

A. 
Short answer, yes. Just as choosing not to invest in education but instead investing in prisons, 
failing to adapt to digital currency would be a waste of an important opportunity.

Q.
How would a U.S.-backed digital currency change transactions globally? 

A. 
With proper use cases that solve real world problems, I can see how creating a strong digital currency might reduce the GDP to national debt ratio, leading to a stronger US dollar. However, it could cause the dollar to lose value i'd rather speculate on an alternate senario. Imagine if instead of hiring 10,000 tax collecters, the Biden administration would decide to hire a handful of ethical and bright-minded developers. This adminstration could be focusing 
on solving problems like 

1) the crumbling bridges and infrastructure, 
2) inequal distribution of resources in schools, and 
3) the high cost of healthcare.

A U.S.-backed digital currency, implemented utilizing blockchain technology with a viable use case, could have ripple effects that change transactions globally. But, only if the use case leveraged solutions that tapped into increasing the potential of the most vulnerable citizens and future generations.

Q.
What would it mean for fees that banks charge for transactions? 

A. 
Bitcoin was created to  Government leaders, the Banking system, and the 1% abuse their position to increase profits with little re-investment to improve the peoples' condition. We see Pharmaceutical companies push deadly drugs and overcharge patients for financial gain. Billionaire CEOs pay less in taxes than you or me. Yet working people and those on fixed incomes struggle to stay above water, getting poorer in the process. 

Some banks may try extend policies that punish account holders for being poor in order to maintain their fee structures, same as they do with fiat. Maybe they'll put systems in place to charge account holders for not meeting monthly minimum balances. Maybe they'll try and withhold funds like they do when someone wants to transfer or withdraw less than $20 from an account.  I don't know what it means for the future of fees, but when it comes to options, people have more choices when it comes to avoiding fees  

Q. Further, what does it mean for decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? 

With that said, cryptocurrencies have for the most part, disrupted the system. 





From the moon landing and the creation of Jazz & Hip Hop, to the development and distribution of the Covid vaccine, it would be wise to put energy into a few things first.

1) Becoming educated on how the the technology is implemented. 
2) Knowing there is a beneficial use case behind the technology.


It's not all about the money. If the government decides 
to create a digial currency, I'd be wary of investing unless there's a use case that I believed would improve the quality of life for me 
and my community. Crypto is has become more real than dollars. Everybody knows about what happened when our Government decided to go off 
the Gold standard. Inflation rose higher than a line in a Maya Angelou poem. 


Beyond the investment possibility,from the perspective of an investor, I'd want to do my due diligence at the risk of getting scammed. 



  purpose and intention. 

If our government decides to develop a digital currency, there has to be a reason that benefits me as an average person. 

As an investor, I want to know the use case before I get involved in an investment. 

Questions I have are: Between data privacy and the proposed use case, how is it going to affect me and my community? 
At this point there's a degree of freedom from my computer's cookie data being handled, shared and used to manipulate my worldview, 
feeding back to me only what it thinks I'll buy, or get angry about. 



What kind of technology is involved? Will the new digital currency be mindful of protecting my privacy? 





"Markets are being used as a tool to initiate change and unleash dynamism, but speculation is suppressed in order to maintain economic, social, and political stability."
